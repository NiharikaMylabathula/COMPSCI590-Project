# COMPSCI590-Project
This project provides a comparative evaluation of modern causal matching methods in high-dimensional settings.
We benchmark six methods—Propensity Score Matching (PSM), Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW), LASSO Coefficient Matching (LCM), Causal Forests (CF), MALTS, and Genetic Matching (GM)—using synthetic datasets with continuous covariates and heterogeneous treatment effects.
Experiments are conducted across varying sample sizes and feature dimensions, following the data generation process from Parikh et al. (2022).
We analyze both estimation accuracy and computational scalability, offering insights into the practical strengths and limitations of each method.
